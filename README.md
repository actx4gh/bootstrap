Python-based CLI tool designed to manage a provisioning system for servers, particularly for a service called CloudIQ. Its main purpose is to handle tasks like provisioning, updating, configuring, and testing products on a server. Here's an overview of its intended functionality:
Key Features:

    Server Provisioning and Configuration:
        The script allows servers to be provisioned, which means preparing and configuring the server for a specific role (e.g., running certain products).
        It uses configuration files, both static (like bootstrap.ini) and dynamic, to track server states and product settings.

    Subcommand-based CLI:
        It operates based on a CLI with subcommands such as product.set, product.get, server.provision, server.mode, and product.upgrade.
        These subcommands interact with the server's configuration, allowing you to:
            Set/Get product configuration (product.set / product.get).
            Provision the server (server.provision).
            Upgrade products on the server (product.upgrade).
            Check server mode or change the mode (server.mode).

    Heartbeat Checking:
        There are functions (heartbeat_get, hearbeat_checkup_appstack, etc.) to check the health and status of specific services running on the server, ensuring they're operational (like haproxy or deepfiler).

    Process Locking:
        The script ensures that long-running tasks (like provisioning or upgrading) don't run concurrently by using PID file locks (PidFile class).

    Error Handling:
        Custom exceptions (BootStrapException) handle various error scenarios, ensuring that invalid operations (like trying to upgrade when a lock is present) are gracefully managed.

    Callback Functionality:
        When certain operations (like provisioning or upgrading) are completed, the script can trigger a callback URL, notifying an external service of the operation's outcome.

    Dynamic Configuration:
        The dynamic configuration is stored in /var/bootstrap, and it is updated as the server's state changes (e.g., during provisioning or upgrades).

High-Level Process:

    Initialization: The script reads from static and dynamic configuration files to load the server's current state and the products it manages.
    Commands: Users can pass in commands like provisioning, setting product configuration, or upgrading products via the CLI.
    Execution: The commands are executed, modifying the server's configuration or performing operations like product upgrades.
    Locking: Long-running commands lock the server using a PID file to prevent concurrent changes.
    Error Reporting: Any issues (invalid keys, modes, or scripts) are caught and reported to the user or a callback system.

This script is likely part of an automated deployment system, enabling a cloud infrastructure to manage the lifecycle of various services and products running on servers.
